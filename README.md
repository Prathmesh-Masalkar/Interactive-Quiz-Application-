INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION

OVERVIEW:- Build an interactive quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions and receive feedback. Use JavaScript to handle quiz logic (e.g., scoring, question navigation). Display results at the end of the quiz.

Step 1: Set up the HTML structure
Create an HTML file to structure the quiz interface.

index.html

Step 2: Style the quiz using CSS
Create a CSS file to style the quiz.

styles.css

Step 3: Add JavaScript for quiz logic
Create a JavaScript file to handle the quiz logic, including scoring and navigation.

script.js

This setup provides a basic but functional interactive quiz application where users can answer multiple-choice questions, receive immediate feedback, and view their score at the end. You can further enhance this application by adding more features such as time limits, question shuffling, or storing user scores.
